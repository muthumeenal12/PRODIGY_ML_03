# SVM Model for Cat and Dog Classification

This repository contains the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for classifying images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained using a dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs.

## Notebook Overview

- **Notebook Link**: [SVM_CAT_DOG.ipynb](https://github.com/muthumeenal12/PRODIGY_ML_03/blob/main/SVM_CAT_DOG.ipynb)
- **Objective**: To classify images as either cats or dogs using an SVM classifier.
- **Dataset**: The notebook utilizes a specific dataset for training and evaluation.
